Speak Out Project

Overview
    A web-based project called Speak Out that seeks to give users a forum to express their views on various societal problems. Users can participate in the initiative by posting on various subjects, sharing their posts, and commenting and liking the posts of other users. Speak Out wants to foster meaningful conversations between users and the promotion of free expression.

Architecture
    A backend and a frontend are the two major parts of the high-level architecture for the Speak Out project. User identification, data storage, and data delivery to the interface are all handled by the backend component. We used Firebase, a serverless cloud platform that provides a variety of services, such as authentication, databases, storage, and hosting, to execute this component. The data and functions of our program are displayed to users by the frontend component. To enhance the design and user experience of our application, we used Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS templates in addition to fundamental web development technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Before starting to write the code, we also worked together and had a design of what we wanted our site to look like. We used figma to implement this and a link has been attached to the figma file. https://www.figma.com/file/FWsIuFmDHju8zYNRblg8JZ/Speak-out?node-id=222%3A318&t=XA9bhsYCs9X7xxZT-1
