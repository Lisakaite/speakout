Speak Out Project

Overview
    A web-based project called Speak Out seeks to give users a forum to express their views on various societal problems. Users can participate in the initiative by posting on various subjects, sharing their posts, and commenting and liking the posts of other users. Speak Out wants to foster meaningful conversations between users and the promotion of free expression.

Architecture
    A backend and a frontend are the two major parts of the high-level architecture for the Speak Out project. User identification, data storage, and data delivery to the interface are all handled by the backend component. We used Firebase, a serverless cloud platform that provides a variety of services, such as authentication, databases, storage, and hosting, to execute this component. The data and functions of our program are displayed to users by the frontend component. To enhance the design and user experience of our application, we used Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS templates in addition to fundamental web development technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features
    1. User authentication: Users can create an account and log in to the platform.
    2. Create and share posts: Users can create and share posts on various topics, including social issues, politics, and current events.
    3. Comment and like: Users can engage with other users' posts through comments and likes.
    4. Search functionality: Users can search for posts and users using keywords.
    5. User profile: Users have a profile page that displays their posts and activity on the platform.
